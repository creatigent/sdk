# Tour of Heroes AngularJS example

This is an adaptation of the angular.io tutorial "Tour of Heroes" which uses Cloud CMS as a backend.

Create the gitana.json file for your Cloud CMS project in this folder by either using the cloudcms-cli or
download from "API Keys" under "Manage Project" in the Cloud CMS Project.

Then do:
  npm install
  ng serve --open

After a connection is established to the Cloud CMS API server a check is made to see if the custom
type with qname "demo:hero" exists. If it does not then it is installed for you and one sample record
is created with title: "Test Hero 1".

This example uses direct connection to the Cloud CMS API which is not recommended for production as it
exposes the security keys in gitana.json. However, basic Create, Read, Update, Delete, Query operations
are demonstrated.
