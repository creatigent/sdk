# Tour of Heroes AngularJS example

This is an adaptation of the angular.io tutorial "Tour of Heroes" which uses Cloud CMS as a backend.

There are two applications is in this project. The first is the front-end app in this folder. The second
is a cloudcms-server (https://github.com/gitana/cloudcms-server) based application server back-end which
implements a custom API to serve the front-end.

To build and run these applications:

    1. Build the front-end application:
        1. npm install
        2. ng build --prod
           (Final compiled files will be written to server/public)

    2. Build and run the back-end application:
        1. cd server
        2. Create the gitana.json file for your Cloud CMS project in the server folder using the
        cloudcms-cli (https://www.cloudcms.com/documentation/cli) or download from "API Keys"
        under "Manage Project" in your Cloud CMS Project.
        3. npm install
        4. npm start
        5. Open in your browser and go to: http://localhost:2999
            After a connection is established to the Cloud CMS API server a check is made to see if
            the custom type with qname "demo:hero" exists. If it does not then it is installed for you
            and one sample record is created with title: "Test Hero 1".
